    Hint
    Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
    
    Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.
    
    Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: k = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
    Example 2:
    
    Input: k = 2
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
    Example 3:
    
    Input: k = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
     
    
    Constraints:
    
    1 <= k <= 105
