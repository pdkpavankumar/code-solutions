/**
  Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
  According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

  Example:
  Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
  Output: 3 
  Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
               received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
               Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
               two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
  Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

/**

 * @return {number}

var hIndex = function(citations) {
    if(citations.length === 0) {return 0;}
    citations = citations.sort((a,b) => b-a);

        if(citations[i] > 0) {
            if(citations[i] >= num + 1) {
                num++;
            } else { break; }
